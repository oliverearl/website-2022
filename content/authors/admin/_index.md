Passionate about both programming and education, I consider myself a dual practitioner, bringing together multiple years of industry experience as a software engineer upon a concrete academic foundation, additional years of classroom teaching experience, and a wealth of pastoral knowledge acquired from volunteerism within student welfare.

## By day...

I'm a full-stack software engineer at [Stickee Technology](https://www.stickeetechnology.com), with a serious interest in building robust and innovative experiences on the web and beyond.

**Some of the technologies I love:** Laravel, Vue.js, Nuxt, Tailwind, and more recently, TypeScript and Inertia.js.

## By night...

What started as a hobby project during the 2020 lockdown, I'm working on a multitude of upcoming video games under [Petrobolos Games](https://www.petrobolos.com) with the help of some friends.

After I almost passed away in 2021 from vaccine complications, I began work on [ExtraContinue](https://www.extracontinue.com), an app that will help you take care of things should you ever disembark your mortal life prematurely.

Mental health is a cause close to my heart. I volunteer a substantial amount of time to the [Nightline Association](https://www.nightline.ac.uk) as a Regional Coordinator, with the aim of ensuring all students in Wales have someone to talk to without judgment and in complete anonymity.
