I'm an experienced, industry-hardened full-stack developer with a passion for clean, readable code and documentation, built upon a concrete academic foundation and additional years of classroom CS teaching experience.

## By day

I currently work as a software engineer at [Stickee Technology](https://www.stickeetechnology.com), with a serious interest in building robust and performative experiences on the web and beyond.

In addition, I volunteer my time with the [Nightline Association](https://www.nightline.ac.uk) as part of their software engineering team, where I have the pleasure of programming innovative IT and software solutions for student-led Nightlines across the UK.

**Some of the technologies I love working with:** Laravel, Vue.js, Nuxt, Tailwind, TypeScript, and more recently, Inertia.js.

## By night

Mental health is a cause close to my heart. I am the twice elected Wales Regional Coordinator within the aforementioned Nightline Association; the aim of which is ensuring that all students have someone to talk to without judgment and in complete anonymity.

After being severely unwell with COVID-19, I began work on [ExtraContinue](https://www.github.com/extracontinue), a website and app to help you organise messages and events should the unforeseeable occur. I'm hoping to have a working release by the end of the year.

Lastly, I'm hoping to some day release numerous video games written in Godot under my indie game studio, [Petrobolos](https://www.petrobolos.com). Emphasis on some day!
